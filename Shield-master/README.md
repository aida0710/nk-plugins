# Shield
A PocketMine-MP plugin which adds functionable shields

This plugin adds vanilla shields and works perfectly the same as vanilla Minecraft.

Hold the shield, in either hand, crouch to activate and uncrouch to deactivate.

The attacker will get knock back when trying to hit a player that is blocking.

The shield gets a short cooldown when swinging the arm.
